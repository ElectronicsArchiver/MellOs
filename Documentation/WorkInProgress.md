### Work in progress
- Dynamic, Modular Shell (will run executables when processes will be a thing)
- Floppy Disk Driver (does not work with USB floppy adapter, so I can only work on it when I'm at home, which is quite rare considering I live a fairly long way from my uni)

### Future
- Process abstraction
- File System support, most likely USTAR (highly dependant on the floppy disk drivers)
