# Work In Progress

- ***Dynamic Modular Shell***

    *Will run executables when processes will be a thing.*
    
- ***Floppy Disk Driver***

    *Does not work with **USB** floppy adapters,* <br>
    *so I can only work on it when I'm home,* <br>
    *which is quite rare, considering I live a* <br>
    *fairly long way from my university.*

<br>

## Planned

- ***File System support***

    *Most likely **USTAR**, depends <br>
    on the floppy disk drivers.*

- ***Process abstraction***
