# Why

A while ago I was gifted a `1994 Compaq Presario` <br>
and figured I could use it to learn how to write a <br>
simple operating system.

I started writing some real mode programs and <br>
eventually I moved on to a simple 32-bit kernel. 

I decided to share my results and progress for <br>
a couple of reasons, the main of which might <br>
be letting you have fun with it, as I do.

I also wanted to share the ways by which I fixed <br>
my misconceptions, as well as the resources <br>
that helped me whenever I got stuck.
